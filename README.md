# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains a Python library (`rylearn`) of various machine
learning algorithms, implemented from scratch
with NumPy. It is inspired by the Scikit-Learn API.

Note that most of these implementations do not include all of the heuristic
tricks and optimizations that are found in a library like Scikit-Learn, so they
may not reach the same performance and will likely be more sensitive to
hyperparameter settings.

## Algorithms

Below is a list of the currently implemented algorithms:

 * Linear Regression via SGD
 * Logistic Regression via SGD (binary classification only)
